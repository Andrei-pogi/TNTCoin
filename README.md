TNT Coin is a Minecraft BE/PE add-on, inspired by a popular trend on TikTok live streams known as the Minecraft TNT Challenge. In this challenge, streamers try to build or maintain a structure while their viewers send virtual gifts that spawn TNT, causing chaos and destruction.

TNT Coin is designed to make it easy for Minecraft BE/PE players to set up and run the Minecraft TNT Challenge.

```ts
/**
 * The item that will be used to place random block.
 */
export const RANDOM_BLOCK_ITEM = 'minecraft:amethyst_block';

/**
* List of possible blocks when placing random blocks.
*/
export const BLOCKS = [
    'minecraft:stone',
    'minecraft:dirt',
    'minecraft:grass',
    'minecraft:diamond_block',
    'minecraft:emerald_block',
    'minecraft:gold_block',

    "minecraft:pink_wool",
    // ... add more blocks
];
```

- You can easily modify the sounds available in the game by editing also the `scripts/config/config.js` file.

```ts
/**
 * List of sounds that you can play
    */
export const SOUNDS = [
    {
        name: 'Totem',
        sound: 'random.totem'
    },

        name: 'LevelUp',

        sound: ' ... '
    },
    // ... add more sounds
]
```

### Save and Load Game State

- Save player's settings.

### Events

- The game listens for specific script events (e.g., `tntcoin:join`) received from the WebSocket server.
- Players can enable or disable specific events.

## Using WebSocket

If you want to connect your TikTok live stream to Minecraft and trigger in-game actions like automatically dropping TNT when someone sends a gift you'll need to set up a WebSocket server.
