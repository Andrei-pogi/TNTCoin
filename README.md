### Gift Goal

The Gift Goal System in TNT Coin allows you to set specific gift targets for your live stream.

- Choose from available gifts with emojis, set the desired target count, and toggle the display on or off as needed.
- To enable live tracking of gift goals, connect your Minecraft world to [TikTokLiveMCBE](https://github.com/rqinix/TikTokLiveMCBE), a WebSocket server. This connection ensures that as viewers send gifts during your TikTok live stream, the progress towards the goal is updated on the action bar.

### Events

- The game listens for specific script events (e.g., `tntcoin:join`) received from the WebSocket server.
- Players can enable or disable specific event actions.

![TikTok Events](./docs/images/events.png)

### Event Actions

Players can assign custom actions (e.g., **Summon**, **Fill**, **Clear Blocks**, **Play Sound**, **Screen Title**, **Screen Subtitle**) to specific events, such as receiving a gift or a follow.

### Timer

### Block Filling

- Players can specify which block type should be used for filling in settings.
- Players can start and stop the block filling process at any time.
- Players can modify the speed of filling process in settings.

### Clearing Blocks

### Randomized Block Placement

- This feature allows players to place a random block from a predefined list whenever they use a specific item in the game.
- Update the `RANDOM_BLOCK_ITEM` to the desired item ID.
- Modify the `BLOCKS` array from `scripts/config/config.js` file to include any block IDs you want to be randomly selected when the specified `RANDOM_BLOCK_ITEM` is used.

```ts
/**
¬†* The item that will be used to place random block.
¬†*/
export const RANDOM_BLOCK_ITEM = 'minecraft:amethyst_block';

/**
 * List of possible blocks when placing random blocks.
 */
export const BLOCKS = [
    "minecraft:iron_block",
    "minecraft:gold_block",
    "minecraft:emerald_block",
    "minecraft:diamond_block",
    // ... add more blocks here`
];
```

## Adding Custom Sounds

To add custom sounds, ensure your files are in `.ogg` format and place them in your **resource pack** in your desired directory (e.g., `sounds/meme/`). Then, define them in the `sounds/sound_definitions.json` file.

Below is an example of how to structure your custom sounds:

```json
{

  "vine_boom": {
      "category": "meme",
      "sounds": ["sounds/meme/vine_boom"]
  },

  "your_custom_sound": {
      "sounds": ["path/to/your/sound"]
  }

}
```

## Adding Images or Gifts

To add new images or gifts to your screen, place your image files (e.g., `gift-new.png`, `360px x 360px`) in the `textures/tnt-coin/gifts/` folder.

After adding your images, reference them in the `gifts.json` file located in the `ui/` folder. This file controls how the images are displayed on the screen.

Each gift occupies `10%` of the total width, allowing a maximum of 10 gifts to be displayed horizontally at once.

```json
{
  "namespace": "gifts",

  "stack_panel": {
    "type": "stack_panel",
    "orientation": "horizontal",
    "size": ["100%", "100%"],
    "controls": [

      {
        "gift_1@gifts.template": {
          "texture": "textures/tnt-coin/gifts/gift-rose.png"
        }
      },

      {
        "MY_GIFT@gifts.template": {
          "texture": "textures/tnt-coin/gifts/MY-GIFT.png"
        }
      }

    ]
  },

  "template": {
    "type": "image",
    "size": ["10%", "100%"],
    "layer": 1,
    "texture": ""
  }
}
```

## Bridging your TikTok Live and Minecraft with TikTokLiveMCBE

If you want to connect your TikTok live stream to Minecraft and trigger in-game actions like automatically dropping TNT when someone sends a gift you'll need to set up a WebSocket server.
